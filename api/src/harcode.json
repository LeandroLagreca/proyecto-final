You get the complicated and realistic world-building from Liberty City of GTA4 in the setting of lively and diverse Los Santos, from an old fan favorite GTA San Andreas. 561 different vehicles (including every transport you can operate) and the amount is rising with every update. <br />\nSimultaneous storytelling from three unique perspectives: <br />\nFollow Michael, ex-criminal living his life of leisure away from the past, Franklin, a kid that seeks the better future, and Trevor, the exact past Michael is trying to run away from. <br />\nGTA Online will provide a lot of additional challenge even for the experienced players, coming fresh from the story mode. Now you will have other players around that can help you just as likely as ruin your mission.

    "description": "<p>Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. </p>\n<p>Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...</p>\n<p>Portal 2&#39;s core mechanics are very similar to the first game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.</p>\n<p>The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.</p>\n<p>Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The third game in the series, Bioshock takes the story of the underwater confinement within the lost city of Rapture and takes it in the sky-city of Columbia. Players will follow Booker DeWitt, a private eye with a military past; as he will attempt to wipe his debts with the only skill he’s good at – finding people. Aside from obvious story and style differences, this time Bioshock protagonist has a personality, character, and voice, no longer the protagonist is a silent man, trying to survive.<br />\nOpen and bright level design of Columbia shows industrial colonial America in a seemingly endless carnival. But Bioshock is not famous for its visuals, but for its story.  Mystery and creative vision of Irrational Games invite players to uncover the secrets of Columbia’s leader - Zachary Comstock and save Elizabeth, the girl, that’s been locked up in the flying city since her birth.<br />\nUnique weapons and mechanics of Vigor will make encounters different, helping players to adjust to the new found mobility and hook shot, making fights fast-paced and imaginative.</p>",

The plot will go through the life of Maxine, a teenager in possession of curious power, allowing her to stop and rewind time, in order to manipulate her surroundings. Max, after the reunion with her friend Chloe, is on the path to uncovering the secrets of Arcadia Bay. Players will have to deal with puzzle solving through the fetch quests, in order to change the world around them. <br />\nThe game puts players in situations, where they’re forced to make a moral choice, going through the decision which may have short-term or long-term consequences. Every choice made by the player will trigger the butterfly effect, surrounding the first playthrough of the game with a lot of emotional struggle, thoughtfully crafted by the developers at Dontnod Entertainment. Life is Strange is third person adventure game, where players might seem just as an observer of the stories, unfolding in front of them.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason. In the first game he saved the planet from alien invasion, this time, when the invasion is already begun, the world needs his help one more time. And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. <br />\nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving.</p>",

After customizing the facial features of the character, players will be admitted to the Vault 111 with their family, and tricked into entering the cryogenic capsule.

In the second game of the series, titular witcher is involved in the inner conflicts of Temeria, where he stopped the rebellion and was hired as a bodyguard of Temerian King Foltest. Eventually, Foltest was assassinated by a witcher-like assassin, and the only person fitting the description was Geralt. <br />\nThe game combat system was reworked, in order to add traps and ranged throwing weapon, giving players more control over the course of the battle. It’s still a third person action RPG, and the player can upgrade and improve general abilities, swordsmanship, alchemy, and magic. <br />\nThe enhanced edition includes additional hours of content, new cinematics, the original soundtrack, game manual and quest handbook, among other things. The new tutorial allows players to spend more time to master new game mechanics and see for themselves visual improvements to the core game.</p>",

Lost Coast story is conveyed without cutscenes, every part of the level is tailored specifically to demonstrate the changes, made by developers. Even though it was originally created for the Half-Life 2, it was removed from the main game, alongside some minor story details. It’s not a full standalone game and wasn’t intended as one.</p>",

Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway. Enhanced edition improves every aspect of the game as graphics and the productivity of it, while Director&#39;s Cut does the same without censorship for North America&#39;s version.</p>",

Your surroundings help you a lot as well by listening to nearby chat or news reports. Players are given as much freedom as possible to find your professional style in the art of killing.

    "description": "<p>Direct continuation of the Half-Life 2, Episode One serves as a direct sequel to the story. After the mystically assisted escape from the citadel, Gordon and Alyx are reunited outside, but the Citadel core became unstable and will imminently self-destruct. And the only way to save citizens of City 17 is to re-enter the decaying building and slow down the destruction for long enough, to evacuate the civilians and families. <br />\nContinuation of the story uses the same Source engine, and players will have to traverse linear stages, disposing of enemies and solving physics puzzles. This time Gordon will be accompanied and assisted by Alyx. Her AI will attempt to adjust to the player choices. While purchasing Episode One, players will receive a copy of Half-Life: Deathmatch with it. Game mechanics and puzzles will center around Gravity Gun, which will be the first weapon in players possession from the beginning.</p>",

Color-coded elements of the environment guiding players as to where they can progress. Special attention to the camera that will bob up in down in accordance with the movement, trying to recreate the actual vision, and not a fixed video feed. Even though Mirror’s Edge has a combat system, it’s not the main focus, which makes it scarce.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Line is the tenth entry into the Spec Ops series, as well as a modernized reboot. Following the worst recorded sandstorms in Dubai, Captain Martin Walker was sent to investigate the events that took place in the city, after it was cut off from all transport and communication. So now the squad of the elite soldiers has to discover, what was meant by the last message they received from the dense wall of raging sand.<br />\nSpec Ops: The Line places the attention on the squad mechanics, where players can give orders to the NPCs, accompanying the player during the game. Aside from the single-player story campaign, players can join the multiplayer matches, which may vary from the solo/team deathmatch to “King of the Hill” type matches. Cooperative missions for two players have been added shortly after the game release. The single player campaign allows players to experiment with the weapons, carrying two at a time and use the environments to their advantage, using hazardous sandstorm to clear-out the enemies.</p>",

Six is a starving little girl in a yellow raincoat, which is trapped in a mysterious vessel named the Maw.

Six can run, crawl, climb, push or pull, and in rare cases carry an object she can throw to stagger an enemy or solve a puzzle. The game gives players the ability to carry a lighted match at any time, inviting players to explore and search for the collectible statues. <br />\nLittle Nightmares have 3 DLC levels, expanding the game beyond the perspective of Six, where the Runaway Kid, a young boy, who is trying to catch up to Six and having his own adventure, going through the Maw in the extra chapters, named “The Depths”, “The Hideaway” and “The Residence.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Titular best-selling psychological thriller author was going through a writer’s block, but when he tries to take a small vacation, it seems that he is attacked and has to fight off the “darkness” that possess people and animals alike. Action-adventure with horror elements, Alan Wake is paced like a thriller show, cinematic and slow, which is in alignment with the visual style of the rural region of Washington and linear storytelling. The main enemy, encountered by the players will be Taken – possessed by darkness creatures and humans that cannot be attacked outright, because they are shrouded in black smoke, blocking the attacks. Only after dispelling the darkness with a source of light players are able to affect the enemies. When the enemies are getting too close, Alan can perform a slow-motion dodge.<br />\nTwo more episodes were published for the first game, called “The Signal” and “The Writer”, directly continuing the story of the main game, and completing the first season.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Welcome to Steelport, a city that’s been torn by the three violent gangs. And seemingly, only another violent gang can stop them. After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. <br />\nWhile being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism.</p>",

Granted, single-player campaign of Half-Life 2 was impressive, but weapons that have been demonstrated in it made players curious. They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition, based on the main game, which was a separate product, distributed on Steam. <br />\nThe game includes two major modes, which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible, to gain points. Player or team with the most points win, and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing. Players can expect fast-paced matches with instant respawns.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Half-Life is the original game in the series. Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However, the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.</p>\n<p>One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.</p>",

Meat Boy has only one life and cannot take any damage, but there is no limit on attempts, so players can try and fail the stage until they get it right or collect special bandages. Unique replay system will show the player every try they made at the same time right after they completed the level.<br />\nSuper Meat boy has multiple characters, some of them are a different skin for Meat Boy and in-game adaptations of other indie-game protagonists, that can be unlocked by completing their special challenge levels, hidden somewhere in the campaign; or by collecting set amount of bandages. Players will be able to choose any unlocked character for any level from the main menu. The game gives players access to the community created maps, but even without it – Super Meat Boy offers more than 300 levels.</p>",

While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games.</p>\n<p>The game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you&#39;ll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.</p>\n<p>Prey&#39;s gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition is an extended version of fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us based on the imaginary universe of DC Comics. The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. <br />\nInjustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2.</p>",

The game mixes the element of fighting and hacks and slashes with a heavy focus on multiplayer. </p>\n<h3>Plot and setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in the medieval fantasy world and follows the conflict between three factions: the Iron Legion, the Chosen, and the Warborn. Each fraction represents a specific medieval culture: knights, samurai, and Vikings respectively. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay incorporates elements of the hack-and-slash and fighting game. The player can choose from more than 12 different characters from each of the fractions. The all have their unique moves, weapons, characteristics, abilities, and executions. The fighting system is based on the duel between players. It incorporates the variety of moves such as attacks from different angles, blocks, dodges, stuns, counterattacks, unblockable attacks, and faints. <br />\nEach character has its progression system which allows one to gain new perks, upgrade weapons, armor as well as the increase in rank that affects matchmaking process. <br />\nThere are six multiplayer modes: they primarily differ from each other by the number of the players involved in the conflict. The multiplayer modes do not feature any PvE battles — the leftovers are team elimination, flag capture and one on one battles.</p>",

She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover&#39;s soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. </p>\n<p>When not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to &quot;focus&quot; and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with an open world. The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.</p>\n<p>The main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.</p>\n<p>The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player&#39;s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.</p>",

She works with the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret governmental organization that deals with the paranormal phenomena, often by annihilating it as a threat. The Bureau headquarters, known as the Oldest House, is taken over by a supernatural power called the Hiss. The director of Bureau, Zachariah Trench, is killed, and Faden is unexpectedly promoted to his place, while the ghost of her predecessor haunts her. She has to travel the endless corridors of the Oldest House and defeat the Hiss using magical Director&#39;s Pistol. </p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>Most of the game takes place in the FBC building, which is a high-rise on Manhattan. The Oldest House is a non-euclidian space, which is larger on the inside. Its corridors and rooms change shape and positions depending on the rituals its inhabitants perform. The Oldest House stores the magical artifacts called Altered Items.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Faden from the third person view. To defeat her enemies, she uses various superhuman powers, such as telekinesis or levitation. She also wields the shape-shifting Director&#39;s Pistol and the magic artifacts she can obtain as a reward for completing quests. Jesse&#39;s skills grow throughout the game. </p>\n<p>There is no multiplayer mode.</p>",

The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Don&#39;t Starve Together is surrealistic and grim survival game made up for six people simultaneously. Initially, Don&#39;t Starve is a single-player game with a core mechanic of going through various problems of your character. You have to sleep and eat well. Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don&#39;t Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>\n<p>While heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don&#39;t Starve.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Journey is an indie game placed in a setting of the vast desert. The protagonist is a nameless and speechless figure moving towards the distant mountain. The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. </p>\n<p>The game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another’s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.</p>",

Both games are based on the world of Dmitry Glukhovsky&#39;s novel Metro 2033 - in post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of subway lines groups of very different people survive. And not only people. There are mutated people there, and mutated animals. They are distinguished by unusual abilities, but even more - behaviour strategies. In the struggle for the remnants of resources, all these beings spend their gloomy days.<br />\nAll characters use unusual and unexpected means for life and war. Something is created from the remnants of a past, normal life, something has already appeared in a new, changed world.<br />\nLocations are struck by an unusual synthesis of the ruins of a known world and traces of a catastrophe.<br />\nFrom the previous game Metro: Last Light differs, according to general opinion, by careful work on the remarks and shortcomings of the previous game. The set of weapons is significantly expanded, the technologies of Metro 2033 have become more developed.<br />\nThe game has two fundamentally different endings and five additions.</p>",

The action adventure game with the real-time strategy elements in the open world introduced a star voice cast, compiled by musicians that became prototypes for some of the characters players will encounter during the game. Aside from the main story, players will be able to encounter dozens of side missions that may vary from the defense battles to a race. When using his V-guitar named Clementine, Eddie can cast spells, called Solos, by a simple rhythm game, reminiscent of Guitar Hero. Some story missions are so-called Battles of the Bands, where players will fight the armies in a real-time strategy fashion, and winning by outperforming the enemy band and destroying the stage.</p>",

Originated as a mod for Half-Life, the developers were signed by Valve Corporation thus beginning the franchise that exists to this very day. </p>\n<p>Having no particular plot or story at all, Counter-Strike was a competitive game mostly used as PvP. With new physics and a large amount of weaponry, you can choose between two fractions - Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. Each team had their signature weapon (CTs had M16 while T had AK-47, for example), the main goal of every round was to kill the opposite team or fulfil a task.  In case there is a bomb plant - detonate or prevent, hostages - rescue or prevent from it or assassination. One player from the team is chosen as a VIP person that must be protected, and the goal of the opposite team is to kill this VIP. By winning every round, you received a good payment, by loosing - much lesser one. You can spend cash on buying equipment and weapon. Counter-Strike franchise is still loved to this day, and even such old shooters live to this day.</p>",

Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. </p>\n<p>With having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game.

For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Heavy Rain is an interactive drama telling the story of the investigation of a serial murder’s case. Players assume roles of four people – Ethan Mars, Norman Jayden, Madison Paige, and Scott Shelby – somehow involved in the case of Origami Killer, who is used to leave his victims alone, marked with origami figures. It soon reveals that all Origami Killer’s murders are connected with weather changes (actually heavy rains). In the course of the completion, players will follow the characters on their way to the key of the murderer’s mystery. Heavy Rain is an unusual action-adventure game. All four main characters are controlled from the third-person perspective with only several buttons, as the interaction with the environment is usually done by activating on-screen prompts like holding the trigger, pushing a button, positioning the stick, or all in one. The gameplay consists of multiple scenes, which affect the further in-game progress by the players’ choice and create a branching storyline that can lead to various endings including the death of certain main characters.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mafia II is the second game in the franchise about Italian mafia operating in America after World War II. Vito Scalleta returns from the war in Italy being wounded. As he returns and reunites with his friend Joe, he and Henry Tomassino convince Vito to be apart of an Italian mafia in fictional city Empire Bay. Starting to work for Alberto Clemente, Vito must go through every aspect of being a part of the family and become a big thing in it.</p>\n<p>Even though the game has an open world mechanic, you won&#39;t probably explore it. Travelling to missions give an opportunity to listen to music of this time in America - Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Dean Martin and others, providing the game with a great atmosphere of the USA in its 50s. The gameplay has a variety of missions to offer, in which you can confront your enemies in melee combat, shoot them with different guns like M1911 or Thompson, or stealthily engaging your opponents. The game is pretty strict to the player reaching highest of empathy with Vito and every situation he&#39;s in.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the latest installment in the Resident Evil series. For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. <br />\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.</p>",

There are six regions in the New World, each with its own base camp. The camps are where you have to thoroughly prepare before every expedition, gathering equipment and provision. Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter’s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system. Many items that you found on missions, including body parts of monsters, can be used for crafting.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Trine II takes a few years after the first game. Successfully saving the kingdom, Amadeus seeks the fireball spells. Yet he is summoned to save the homeland with his friends - Zoya and Pontious. Goblins have taken over the land as they are trying to find the mysterious &quot;Witch&quot; deep in the forest. </p>\n<p>Although having more than one playable character, Trine successfully uses all three of them. Amadeus as the mage is able to move objects or create boxes and planks to help overcome some obstacles. Zoya is very agile so she can hook and grapple on some surfaces, or shoot different targets. Pontious is the strongest character in combat, and he can destroy walls in his path or deflect things with his shield. Having this three different characters, it is necessary to use all three of them to solve puzzles and beat the level. Not only you can play alone, but the game supports three players cooperative to make progress even more atmospheric. </p>\n<p>Beautiful design, music and a narrator makes Trine a great story, that feels inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien himself.</p>",

Although the game is a part of the Battlefield franchise, it has no references to the previous chapters. Players are able to experience both single and multiplayer mods to get in action and to feel the era better. As a single-player campaign, Battlefield 1 offers 6 storylines (chapters) one following each other. Each consists of several missions and tells a story of a single man in the middle of a global military conflict. Playing for these soldiers and closing the targets introduces new game mechanics to players. Completing these missions gives an opportunity to dive into the history and to examine the warfare of past ages. Multiplayer experience is divided into 9 different game mods spread on 31 historical maps. You can join the dynamic battle alone or in a squad with your friends. Multiplayer allows you to assume different battlefield roles (classes) starting with a medic, support or assault and following to the tank driver, pilot and some elite units.</p>",

Such conflicts serve as the leitmotif through the entirety of a game — not only we are choosing sides to fight on in the Civil War, but also we are facing the decisions of choosing Assassins&#39; or Templar&#39;s side.<br />\nAs it is common in the Assasin&#39;s Creed games, the gameplay concentrates profoundly around fighting the multiple enemies all at once, parkouring off walls and micro-management: selling resources, exchanging ships and so on. The Assassin&#39;s Creed III, however, highlights the hunting and simultaneous use of two weapons as the new in-game features.</p>",

However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.<br />\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Unturned is a low-poly survival game providing single or multiplayer experience. The main action takes place on 6 different maps (Prince Edward Island, Yukon, Washington, Germany and Russia) flooded with zombies. The story begins in the random location of the chosen map and lasts till the death. Playing for one of the few people not yet turned into a zombie, you should stay aware of various natural or unnatural dangers, gather required resources, and make your way through the tough survival. Survivors meet thirst, hunger, disease, injures, zombie bites, and other hostile players looking for safety. Since land, air and sea vehicles are available, players can choose the most suitable transport to explore the entire map. The gameplay stands for the wider opportunity of customization of pretty much everything in the in-game world, starting with simple object destruction and following to guns modification and shelters construction. In-app purchases do not actually affect the gameplay, but due to the cosmetic system, plenty of items (clothing and weapon skins) are purchasable or available in crates.</p>",

There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. </p>\n<p>If there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion.

Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.</p>\n<p>As in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Far Cry 4 is a first-person shooter, which inherits traditions of the original Far Cry franchise. However, the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East, where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland, but suddenly things go the wrong way, and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses, players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning, the whole map is not available, so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Resident Evil 5 (also known as Biohazard 5 in Japan) is the third-person shooter with elements of a survivor-horror game.

As the members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, they are tasked to intercept an illegal bioweapon trade in Kijuju, Africa. Upon arrival, they find out that Kijuju is infected by Las Plagas, parasites that turn its carriers into zombie-like creatures.   <br />\nThe game is notable for being a departure from the series survival horror roots towards more action-oriented gameplay style. The other significant innovation in the series brought with Resident Evil 5 is cooperative multiplayer for two players. There are many situations during the game that requires two players cooperation therefore if in singleplayer the second characters is controlled by AI.</p>",

As far as the action is set in the timeframes of the Iraq War, the two opposing sides are U.S. troops and Iraqi rebels. The gameplay is divided into 9 PvP modes (Push, Firefight, Skirmish, Ambush, Occupy, Infiltrate, Flashpoint, and Elimination) and 5 co-op modes (Checkpoint, Hunt, Survival, Outpost, and Conquer). PvP matches are held according to 9 various scenarios (depending on the chosen game mode) with the maximum of 32 player count (16 for both sides). To start a match, players have to select a character class and proper equipment. In the co-op game mode, players are offered to compete with AI during the completion of a specific game objective.</p>",

Each planet you visit is generated from scratch. The information about the planets and their inhabitants is dynamically updated so every player can discover a new species or planet and give it a name.</p>\n<p>No Man&#39;s Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player&#39;s ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. </p>\n<p>On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience.</p>",

The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation&#39;s soldiers is now the alien ship &quot;The Avenger&quot;, converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.<br />\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.<br />\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.</p>",

The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Shadowrun Returns is a science fiction tactical RPG. The game became a revival of the original Shadowrun series, as the new chapter had some references to the 1993 Shadowrun. The Shadowrun universe includes several fictional cyberpunk elements because the main action takes place in the future. The game gives an opportunity to assume the role of a shadowrunner and to investigate a mysterious crime. To start a single campaign called Dead Man’s Switch players are offered to create their own character. The story begins in 2054 in Seattle, when the nameless protagonist receives a message from their shadowrunner accomplice Sam Watts, which was triggered by a dead man’s switch. The message is about Sam’s assassination, and the protagonist is aksed to investigate the case for Sam’s 100 thousand of local currency. The investigation will lead players through the story of serial killer Emerald City Ripper to the large-scale intergalactic conspiracy. In the course of the investigation, the character will participate in turn based fights and complete in-game objectives. Although the gameplay is mostly linear, it features some exploration and interaction with the environment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br />\nDinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br />\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br />\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br />\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br />\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br />\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br />\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br />\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br />\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br />\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br />\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br />\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

    "description": "<p>SOMA is a sci-fi survival horror that makes you rethink the description of death. You play as Simon Jarrett who was injured in a crash accident and agreed for an experimental operation on his brain. He wakes up at an abandoned underwater facility full of mutants. Trying to figure out what’s going on, Simon finds Catherine Chun, a scientist, who tells him about the technology of copying the human personality.<br />\nThe gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There&#39;s no combat, and you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.   <br />\nThough there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers. Moral choices you have to make don’t affect the story much: instead, they change your attitude to the events, so it’s you who develops through the game.</p>",

The title serves as a spin-off to Tomb Raider series and is not connected to the series storyline whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Two thousand years ago there was a battle between the Guardian of Light and the Keeper of Darkness. The Keeper won using the Mirror of Smoke with which he summoned a horde of horrible monsters, but the Guardian survived the encounter and imprisoned the Keeper in his own mirror. Fast-forward to the present day. Lara Croft finds the legendary mirror, but she does not know what evil it contains. </p>\n<p>The game puts a strong emphasis on cooperative play, yet it is possible to complete the game alone. While the previous installments in the series featured an action third-person camera, Guardian of Light is using a fixed isometric camera. The players can choose to play either as the Guardian himself or as Lara Croft with each character having their own abilities.</p>\n<p>Puzzles differ when played alone or in co-op mode. This was done in order to make the players rely less on AI.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Valiant Hearts is a sidescroller adventure with a significant amount of attention paid to artwork and historical authenticity. While being not so demanding on a software side, it was released on the mobile platforms as well as on the big consoles. Such variety of platforms, however, limits the gameplay peculiarities that can be featured within a game. <br />\nThe player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian, American, French and German side of the Great War conflict — World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races. <br />\nValiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial. The game has received the Best Narrative awards and the Games for Change awards for such a plot-twists.</p>",

    "description": "<p>DiRT Showdown is not a traditional racing simulator of the DiRT series. The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don’t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The third game of the FEAR series of games. The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named &quot;Operative&quot;, and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.<br />\nProtagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.</p>\n<p>The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is &quot;turned on&quot; during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger.</p>",

The game offers action racing that sometimes resembles the demolition derby in an open-world setting of Paradise City. The game has a remarkable damage system that improves the whole experience and interrupts monotonous moves across the city, which is free-to-explore for the first time in a series. With The Ultimate Box edition, developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so graphics became much better. Changes also affected the gameplay. Now players can race and explore the entire map of the city either by car or by bike that were also added. The racing career begins at the dump, where the driver, controlled by players, gets their first car and two new bikes. Players complete races and fill the “driving license” scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the “license” experience.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Swapper is a classical platform game with several elements of Metroidvania focused on solving puzzles. The game follows a female astronaut stranded on the abandoned space research station in a science-fictional universe. Completing the game players will be able to learn more about the fate of researches and to restore the sequence of events held aboard the station. Players assume the role of the protagonist, as she tries to clarify the mystery of a unique item, which allows her to clone herself and to transfer the mind to the clone. Therefore, the cloning ability is a basic game mechanic that helps the player to solve puzzles and complete levels. The gameplay features traditional side-scrolling platformers’ elements: players control the 2D action from the third-person perspective. In the course of the completion, players are going to face obstacles of varying degrees of complexity ranging from simple barriers (however inaccessible for clones) to higher platforms or even gravity shutdowns.</p>",

It is the thirteenth game in the Medal of Honor franchise, but in comparison to the previous ones, its plot is unique. The game is set in the historical period of the War in Afghanistan. The single campaign opens up in 2001 during the invasion of Afghanistan. The action gives an opportunity to participate in the military conflict for the U.S. Navy. In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies’ checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict’s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes’ equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat.</p>",

He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation &quot;Organnon&quot;, to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.</p>",

Although GTA III is another chapter of the franchise, its plot is unique. </p>\n<p>The story begins with the dynamic bank robbery. During the heist scene, the main character (silent and unnamed for the whole game) gets betrayed by his accomplice Catalina.

    "description": "<p>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a singleplayer FPS developed by MachineGames. It is the third installment in the rebooted series.</p>\n<p>Set in the alternate 1961 where Nazi Germany won World War II, the game picks up right at the end of Wolfenstein: The New Order. After sustaining heavy injuries in the battle with Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse, BJ Blaskowicz orders a nuclear strike on Deathshead&#39;s compound in order to cripple the Nazi war machine, but he is evacuated by his comrades before the rocket launch. Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.</p>\n<p>The New Colossus features several stealth-action elements, just like the previous title in the series. There are some major differences in the mechanics: now BJ can modify his weaponry on-the-go, dual wield two different weapons at the same time. The cover system makes a comeback. The Protagonist doesn&#39;t stick to cover, leaning out of it instead.</p>\n<p>The game offers a linear storyline, but the player is free to complete side-missions in any order they like. Completing these missions is rewarded with new weapon upgrades.</p>",

The game allows for a cooperative mode for up to four players. All puzzles are automatically adjusted to the number of players. You can play not only as Lara but also as her friendly rival Carter Bell and two Egyptian gods, Isis and Horus, who were imprisoned in the temple for millenniums by the evil god Set. Their goal is to gather together and revive Osiris, the god who was dismembered by Set, and who can save the Earth from Set&#39;s evil. While human characters use firearms and grappling hooks, the gods are armed with the magic Stuff of Osiris.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the second installment in first-person multiplayer shooter series Counter-Strike. It is the only game in the Counter-Strike main series that includes a single-player campaign. In the campaign, you play as a leader of a special forces squad. You form your team from a cast of pre-made characters with unique features and go on through several unconnected missions. The missions themselves are mostly a string of multiplayer matches played with AI bots and some additional challenges like killing enemies with a specific type of weapon <br />\nThe multiplayer part of the game is very similar to the previous installment. There are two teams in every match: terrorists and counter-terrorists. You choose one of the sites and have to defeat the enemy team by killing hostile players or completing different tasks. For doing this, you also get money rewards which you can spend on more advanced weapons and gear.  <br />\nThe game also features Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, the early version of the game, developed by Ritual Entertainment before the game was handled to Turtle Rock Studios.</p>",

    "description": "<p>South Park: The Stick of Truth is an action RPG based on the American animated series South Park. Players assume the role of the New Kid, who moved to eponymous fictional town in Colorado State with his parents. According to the storyline, the New Kid meets the army of humans led by Wizard King Cartman in the Kupa Keep Kingdom (Cartman’s backyard) and gets his nickname Douchebag. Cartman, as well as other characters of the original series, introduce The Stick of Truth, the key to the war between humans and elves, to the New Kid. Once The Stick is stolen by elves, the war and the whole adventure of Douchebag begins. The game is viewed from the third-person perspective. To start the campaign, players have to choose one of the character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), each with its own parameters and special abilities. Completing the levels and eliminating the enemies gives experience points that could be spent on learning new skills or upgrading the level. The gameplay also features fast travel ability. Remarkable characters of the original series – Cartman, Butters, Stan, and Kyle – join the protagonist during his wild adventure.</p>",

However, after arriving in the bunker, Faulke - director of the facility - states that all of the U.S. military bases have been destroyed and they cannot contact the White House. With that being said, the Bureau is now re-named into XCOM and starts its story from this moment.</p>\n<p>Despite genre difference to its predecessor, The Bureau still focuses on tactical elements of the gameplay.

        "description": "<p>DMC: Devil May Cry is a hack-and-slash adventure game, the fifth installment in Capcom’s Devil May Cry franchise and reboot of the series. This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  <br />\nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features.</p>",

Randomly generated levels, loot, and enemies will provide quite a challenge for those unfamiliar with roguelike games, and will bring joy to the eye of an experienced player.<br />\nThe game’s protagonist is Isaac, a child from a religious family. His misadventures are based off a biblical story about a character of the same name, although the gameplay itself certainly does not follow the same footsteps. There are also additional, unlockable characters with unique abilities and traits, which will affect your playthrough’s difficulty. <br />\nThe Binding of Isaac featured non-linear levels, which brought about different outcomes of the game. Depending on the character played, playstyles can also differ, allowing players to create and share new metals for further replayability, and eventual full completion of the game.</p>",

A soon as the event pace raises and antagonists start pursuing him to get his brains (for building a new Marker), Isaac realizes his only goal – the destruction of the Marker. Players are offered to join the protagonist’s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear – special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.</p>",

It can be summarized as a player has to defeat waves of enemies in different locations using his weapons and magical abilities. However, it also incorporates some role-playing elements such as acquiring gaining new levels which allow a player to enhance his stats and acquire new moves. One of the gameplay’s focal points is cooperative multiplayer with the support for up to 4 players which is available both locally and online.  <br />\nThe game shares significant Behemoth hand-drawn visual style which was used before in Alien Hominid and would be later used in studio’s BattleBlock Theater and Pit People.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fallout 3 is a legendary action RPG, which continues the Fallout franchise. Players dive into the events held 36 years after Fallout 2&#39;s ending. The game is set in the post-apocalyptic open world known as the “Capital Wasteland.” According to the storyline, by 2277, the whole familiar world finds itself devastated. The cataclysm is the consequence of the nuclear war of 2077 between USA and China. The only people left on Earth are lucky ones, who managed to stay alive on the surface, and those, who made their way to the warehouses provided by Vaul-Tech (like the main character). In the very beginning, the protagonist wakes up inside the Vault 101. His only aim is to find his father who left the warehouse some time ago. On his way, he will contact other survivors (both gangs and singles) and explore entire restoring areas of Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, and Maryland. The game offers countless progress opportunities, so the gameplay is overloaded with various features including types of customization, numerous conversations with NPC’s, side quests – everything that an average player is going to face.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games. The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas&#39;s presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. </p>\n<p>Like the rest of Call of Juarez games, Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There&#39;s even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Syberia is an adventure game where a twisted story is combined with puzzle solving and a graphical quest’s elements. You take on the role of Kate Walker, who has to travel over half of Europe to fix her business issues. However, her adventure appears to be exciting and surreal, and, actually, life-changing. Searching for a man to sell her a toy factory, Kate becomes involved in a fantastic journey that leads her to the land of Syberia where mammoths are still alive.<br />\nThe main gameplay activity is classical for point-and-click quests and for the most part is solving numerous complicated puzzles that are tightly connected with the plot development and extend and deepen the story. Huge locations may contain dozens of puzzles, so finding all clues will make you explore every corner of every place. Puzzles often feature work with details from mechanisms and odd inventions. The gameplay supports the surreal atmosphere of the game which twists the reality with human dreams and hopes.<br />\nSyberia is followed by two sequels, Syberia II and Syberia 3, that continue the adventures of Kate Walker.</p>",

And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.<br />\nJodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.<br />\nHer parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.<br />\nThe CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.<br />\nThe game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.</p>",

The genre itself is well-established already with giants like Diablo series, but Torchlight offers the fresh experience for veterans and newbies alike.<br />\n  The steampunk fantasy world lets players enjoy the lush grass of various beautiful environments, the glowing caves filled with mushrooms, and the endless deserts with their treasures! Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.<br />\n  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don’t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge. The world of Torchlight is yours to explore!</p>",

Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. </p>\n<p>The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can&#39;t take multiple attempts to complete a level.

Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.<br />\nThe game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent.

There are a lot of such finds in the game. In addition to shooting, there are chases and other things. And besides weapons - a lot of useful original devices.</p>",

Water is not just a surface, but water, with waves that you swing - in multiplayer, these waves are for everyone, their behavior is calculated exactly as the real waves would behave, players feel them precisely with the same difference for their position, as if they were in the actual sea, on the same wavelength, but in different places. Seven missions, five additions, three variants of the ending. The ability to see the gameplay through the eyes of any of the players, above the entire card, in a third-person mode and in the &quot;Free Cam&quot; mode. Multiple multiplayer modes, classes and game factions.</p>",

You control a spaceship that has to deliver an essential package of data to the Federation headquarters. This data can help defeat the rebel’s army and finish the war. To do so, you have to travel through eight procedurally generated space segments. Within those segments, the player can encounter other ships and NPCs both friendly and hostile as well as random events.  <br />\nThe gameplay’s key feature is that the player does not control the spaceship itself but rather the ship’s crew. During the game, the player can hire or rescue new crew members from different races. Each team member has its characteristics that affect how well he can handle different systems on the ship or his movement speed and fighting skills.  <br />\nThe game is notable for its high difficulty primarily since ship’s destruction causes save files deleting.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The Walking Dead: Season 2 is an episodic adventure game based on eponymous comic book series. As it is a sequel to the previous game in the Walking Dead series, the further story progress depends on the events of the first part. The game is set in the world inhabited by walkers, as the story takes place after the zombie apocalypse. In the second season, players are offered to assume the role of Clementine, a young member of a group of survivors leaving Georgia and heading towards a large survivor camp in Michigan. The girl’s moves are controlled in a point-and-click way. The story progresses through short scenes including dialogues with other characters, which can impact upcoming events by selecting certain dialogue options, or short-term action events like defending the camp from walkers. The gameplay also features some sort of exploration and interaction with the environment that can give extra information or various collectible items. On the way through the game players are going to face dramatic turns of the plot caused by their own tough choice.</p>",

But the further you go, the more you realize there&#39;s somebody except you in the game, who wants you to stop playing. So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what&#39;s happening. <br />\nBesides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again. At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies&#39; guns and ammo or use melee combat. Additional to the campaign mode, there&#39;s the endless one and the challenge to make levels more difficult.</p>",
